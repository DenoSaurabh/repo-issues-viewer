# Answers

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

1) To not reveal the ENV variables, and yes I accidently did.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

1) To change the 2 pages layout into a single page, this helps in better user experience. 

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

1) To have a auto PR merge feature, this can really help in large orginizations getting small & similar PR every day.
2) To make this app installable PWA, so users can have best experience in both mobiles and desktops.
3) Having feature that removes multiple similar issues.

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

1) I decided to make this simple and intuitive UI, this was a simple application and making it 2 pages will not gonna look as easy to use. 

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

This assignment took me around 5 hours.
1) In first 30 mins, I planned the artitecture, tech stack and UI of the app.
2) And then I proceed to build the basic project setup, apollo setup and default styling.
3) In any of my project, I definately build UI Components (and pages) before doing any state or data fetching experimentations.
4) After that, for around 30 mins I begin experimenting with Github GraphQL API, because It was my first time using it.
5) And at last for around 50 mins, I coded up the State Managament, GraphQL queries and updating the UI.
CHALLANGE COMPLETED!

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

To not mix up SCSS and styled-componenets in a single project.

> Did you learn anything new?

Not much, this project was all mix of what I have learned previously, But I definately learned GithubAPI and Emotion. So, thanks for this!

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

Yea, most of that. How I better do style managament/comp styling code. But also, I missed to show how much I focus on Performance, SEO, Error Hanlding and Security in massive applications. (because of lack of time). I believe those are my top unique skills I provide. 

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

Not really, I showed almost of my significant skills.
